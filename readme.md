# SimpleFS – Educational File System

This project implements a simplified file system in C++ for the **INE5412 – Operating Systems** course at UFSC.  
It simulates core file system operations (formatting, mounting, creating, deleting, reading, and writing files) on a virtual disk.  
Additionally, a shell interface and a small graphical interface (via SFML) are included to interact with the file system.
